| M3 nuts | 4 | Hinge assembly | $0.50-1 |

**Subtotal Hardware**: ~$3.50-6

## Tools Required

- Phillips head screwdriver (#1 or #2)
- 3D printer (or access to 3D printing service)
- Computer with OpenSCAD and slicer software

## Optional Components

| Item | Purpose | Approx. Price (USD) |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| USB keyboard/mouse | Setup and use | $15-30 |
| Heatsink/cooling fan | Better thermal management | $5-10 |
| Battery pack (USB-C PD) | Portable power | $30-60 |
| Protective screen film | Display protection | $5-10 |

## Total Project Cost

- **Minimum (without optional parts)**: ~$150-180
- **With stand and optional components**: ~$200-250

## Notes

1. **Raspberry Pi 5 Model**: Both 4GB and 8GB models work. 8GB recommended for better performance.

2. **Display Compatibility**: This case is designed specifically for the **Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2**. It will NOT fit the older Touch Display 1 or third-party displays.

3. **Screw Lengths**: 
   - M2.5: 8mm minimum, 12mm maximum
   - M3: 16mm minimum, 20mm maximum
   - Adjust based on your printed part thickness

4. **3D Printing**: If you don't own a 3D printer:
   - Check local libraries (many now have 3D printers)
   - Visit a local makerspace
   - Use online 3D printing services (upload STL, they ship parts)
   - Ask in local maker communities

5. **Filament Choice**:
   - **PLA**: Easiest to print, good for indoor use
   - **PETG**: More durable, better heat resistance
   - **ABS**: Strongest, but harder to print
