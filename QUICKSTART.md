# Quick Start Guide

Get started with your Raspberry Pi Tablet case in 5 minutes!

## What You Need

✅ Raspberry Pi 5  
✅ Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2  
✅ microSD card with Raspberry Pi OS  
✅ Screws: 8× M2.5 (8-12mm), 4× M3 (16-20mm), 4× M3 nuts  
✅ 3D printer or printing service access  

## 3 Simple Steps

### 1️⃣ Print the Parts (4-8 hours)

Download [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and generate STL files:

```
3d-models/bottom_case.scad  →  bottom_case.stl
3d-models/top_case.scad     →  top_case.stl
3d-models/mounting_brackets.scad  →  mounting_brackets.stl
3d-models/stand.scad        →  stand.stl (optional)
```

**Print Settings:**
- Material: PLA or PETG
- Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20-30%
- Supports: Only for mounting brackets

### 2️⃣ Assemble (30 minutes)

1. **Mount Raspberry Pi** → Screw into bottom case (4× M2.5 screws)
2. **Mount Display** → Screw into top case (4× M2.5 screws)
3. **Attach Brackets** → Connect cases with hinges (4× M3 screws + nuts)
4. **Connect Cable** → Plug display cable into Raspberry Pi

### 3️⃣ Power On & Enjoy! 🎉

Connect power and start using your new tablet!
