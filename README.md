# Raspberry Pi Tablet

A 3D-printable case design for building a tablet using the Raspberry Pi 5 and the official Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2.

## Overview

This project provides complete 3D printer files to create a custom tablet case that houses:
- **Raspberry Pi 5** - The latest single-board computer from Raspberry Pi
- **Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2** - Official 7" touchscreen display

The case design includes adjustable mounting brackets for different viewing angles and an optional desktop stand.

## Project Contents

- **3d-models/** - OpenSCAD source files and documentation for 3D printing
  - Bottom case for Raspberry Pi 5
  - Top case for Touch Display 2
  - Mounting brackets for assembly
  - Optional desktop stand

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the `3d-models/` directory
2. Read the detailed [3D Models README](3d-models/README.md)
3. Open the `.scad` files in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)
4. Export to STL format
5. 3D print the components
6. Assemble with required hardware (M2.5 and M3 screws)

## Features

✅ Parametric OpenSCAD designs (easily customizable)  
✅ Proper port cutouts for all Raspberry Pi 5 connectors  
✅ Ventilation for cooling  
✅ Mounting posts for secure component attachment  
✅ Adjustable viewing angle with hinge design  
✅ Optional desktop stand  
✅ Optimized for FDM 3D printing  

## Requirements
